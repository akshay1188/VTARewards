This application tracks a user's location as they navigate around(in a bus) <br/>

Location tracking starts when a device(iPhone) enters a beacon region (installed on the bus).<br/>
When the device leaves the region, location tracking stops.<br/>

All the location waypoints are tracked and persisted on the device memory.<br/>
